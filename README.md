# Insurance Prediction using Random Forest

This mini-project explores the use of Random Forest classification to predict whether a customer will opt for vehicle insurance. Built on the same dataset used for Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models, this version emphasizes model comparison, class imbalance challenges, and interpretability.

## What I did
- Preprocessed and cleaned the insurance dataset
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report
- Visualized performance with a confusion matrix
- Compared output against previous models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree)

## Accuracy
**Random Forest:** 87.50%  
**Decision Tree:** 82.17%  
**Logistic Regression:** 87.45%

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Next Steps
- Handle class imbalance with class weights or SMOTE
- Move to XGBoost for better performance
